                    <p>Planning a bounce house rental for your next party in Logan, Utah? Follow these essential best practices to ensure everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Choose the Right Size and Location</h3>
                    <p>Before booking your bounce house, consider the number of guests and available space. Our "Bounce Castle with a Slide" accommodates up to 8 children at once. Ensure you have at least 10 feet of clearance on all sides for safe setup and access.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Weather Considerations</h3>
                    <p>Always check the weather forecast before your rental date. Bounce houses should not be used in winds exceeding 20 mph or during rain. We monitor weather conditions and will work with you to reschedule if needed for safety.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Adult Supervision is Essential</h3>
                    <p>Never leave children unattended in a bounce house. Designate at least one responsible adult to supervise at all times. This person should:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monitor the number of children inside (max 8 for our castle)</li>
                        <li>Ensure children remove shoes, jewelry, and sharp objects</li>
                        <li>Prevent rough play, climbing on walls, or flips</li>
                        <li>Keep food and drinks away from the bounce house</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>4. Age-Appropriate Play</h3>
                    <p>Our bounce house is designed for children ages 3-12. Younger children should be supervised more closely, and we recommend separating very young children from older ones to prevent accidents.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Proper Attire</h3>
                    <p>Children should wear comfortable, weather-appropriate clothing. Avoid loose items that could get caught. Socks are recommended for better grip and cleanliness.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6. Emergency Preparedness</h3>
                    <p>Keep a first-aid kit nearby and have emergency contact numbers readily available. Our team provides safety instructions during setup, but it's important to review them with all supervising adults.</p>
                    
                    <h3>7. Cleanup and Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>During the rental period, keep the bounce house clean by removing any debris that enters. We handle all setup, takedown, and cleaning, but maintaining cleanliness during use helps ensure everyone's safety.</p>
                    
                    <h3>8. Communication with Rental Company</h3>
                    <p>At My Bounce Place, we're here to help! Contact us immediately if you notice any issues with the equipment or have safety concerns. Our team is available throughout your rental period for support.</p>

                    <p>In Cache Valley, weather can change quickly. Here's your complete guide to handling stormy weather during your bounce house rental to keep everyone safe.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Before the Storm: Prevention and Preparation</h3>
                    <p>Monitor weather forecasts in the days leading up to your event. If severe weather is predicted, we'll contact you to discuss options. It's always better to reschedule than to risk safety.</p>
                    
                    <h3>During Setup: Weather Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Our team monitors weather conditions during setup. If conditions become unsafe, we may delay or cancel setup. We'll communicate clearly about any changes and work with you to find the best solution.</p>
                    
                    <h3>When Storms Approach: Immediate Actions</h3>
                    <p>If you notice storm conditions developing during your rental:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Immediately evacuate all children</strong> from the bounce house</li>
                        <li><strong>Move everyone to a safe indoor location</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Contact us immediately</strong> at (385) 288-8065</li>
                        <li><strong>Do not attempt to deflate or move the equipment</strong> yourself</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>Storm Safety Guidelines</h3>
                    <p>Bounce houses must be evacuated when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wind speeds exceed 20 mph</li>
                        <li>Lightning is visible or thunder is heard</li>
                        <li>Heavy rain or hail is occurring</li>
                        <li>Any severe weather warnings are issued</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>After the Storm: Safety Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Once the storm passes, our team will assess the equipment before allowing play to resume. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Checking for any damage to the bounce house</li>
                        <li>Ensuring proper anchoring and stability</li>
                        <li>Verifying the blower is functioning correctly</li>
                        <li>Cleaning any debris that may have accumulated</li>
                    </ul>
