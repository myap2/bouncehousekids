# 🏠 Multi-Tenant Bounce House Deployment Guide

## 🎈 What You're Building
A **shared apartment building** where multiple bounce house companies can live, but each company only sees their own stuff!

## 🏗️ Architecture (Simple Version)
```
🌐 Internet
    ↓
🏢 Your App (The Building)
    ↓
🗄️ Database (The Mailroom)
    ↓
📦 Company A Data | 📦 Company B Data | 📦 Company C Data
```

## 🚀 Super Simple Deployment

### Option 1: 🌟 **EASIEST** (Recommended for Beginners)

#### Step 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create free account
3. Create a cluster (choose free tier)
4. Create database user
5. Get connection string
6. Put it in your `.env` file

#### Step 2: Backend Deployment (10 minutes)
1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/)
2. Connect your GitHub
3. Deploy your `server` folder
4. Add environment variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongo-connection-string
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-name
   ```

#### Step 3: Frontend Deployment (5 minutes)
1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
2. Connect your GitHub
3. Deploy your `client` folder
4. Set environment variable:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
   ```

**🎉 DONE! Your multi-tenant app is live!**

### Option 2: 💰 **BUDGET** (One Server for Everything)

#### Single VPS Setup ($5/month)
1. Get a VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)
2. Install Docker
3. Run this command:
   ```bash
   # Copy your files to server
   scp -r . user@your-server:/app
   
   # On server, run:
   cd /app && docker-compose up -d
   ```

## 🏢 How Multi-Tenancy Works

### 1. **Company Registration**
When a new company signs up:
```javascript
// Create company
const company = new Company({
  name: "Bob's Bounce Houses",
  owner: userId,
  plan: "basic"
});

// Make user a company admin
user.role = 'company-admin';
user.company = company._id;
```

### 2. **Data Isolation**
Each company only sees their own data:
```javascript
// Company A admin sees only their bounce houses
GET /api/bounce-houses/my-company
// Returns: Bob's bounce houses only

// Company B admin sees only their bounce houses  
GET /api/bounce-houses/my-company
// Returns: Sally's bounce houses only
```

### 3. **Shared Resources**
Everyone shares the same:
- Application code
- Server infrastructure
- Database instance
- But data is completely separated!

## 🔐 Security Features Already Built

### ✅ **Company Isolation**
- Company A cannot see Company B's data
- Company A cannot modify Company B's bounce houses
- Automatic company assignment for new bounce houses

### ✅ **Role-Based Access**
- **Super Admin** (you): See everything, manage everything
- **Company Admin**: Only their company's data
- **Customer**: Only viewing and booking

### ✅ **Data Protection**
- All API endpoints check company ownership
- Database queries automatically filter by company
- No cross-company data leakage possible

## 🎯 Adding New Companies

### Automatic Registration
1. New company owner signs up
2. Creates company profile
3. Automatically becomes company admin
4. Can start adding bounce houses
5. Customers can find and book from them

### Manual Admin Creation
```javascript
// You (super admin) can create company admins
POST /api/users/create-company-admin
{
  "email": "bob@bouncehouses.com",
  "companyId": "company-a-id",
  "role": "company-admin"
}
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Start Small**
- Deploy with 1-2 test companies first
- Test all the isolation features
- Make sure data doesn't leak between companies

### 2. **Monitor Usage**
- Each company's bounce house count
- Storage usage (images)
- API request patterns

### 3. **Pricing Strategy**
- Free tier: 5 bounce houses
- Pro tier: 50 bounce houses
- Enterprise: Unlimited

### 4. **Customer Support**
- Each company manages their own customers
- You only handle technical issues
- Company admins handle booking disputes

## 🔧 Environment Variables Needed
