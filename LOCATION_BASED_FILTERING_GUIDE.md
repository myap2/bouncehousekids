# üó∫Ô∏è Location-Based Filtering System for Bounce Houses

## üéØ Overview

Your multi-tenant bounce house platform now has a **comprehensive location-based filtering system** that helps customers find bounce houses closest to them! This guide explains all the features and how to use them.

## üè† How It Works

### **The Problem**
Customers need to find bounce houses that can be delivered to their location. Different companies have different delivery areas and charges.

### **The Solution**
Multiple ways for customers to search by location:
1. **Zip Code Search** - Simple and fast
2. **City/State Search** - User-friendly
3. **Coordinates Search** - Most accurate
4. **Delivery Radius Filtering** - Respects company delivery areas
5. **Distance-Based Sorting** - Shows closest first

## üìç Location Search Options

### 1. **Zip Code Filter**
**Simplest option - customers just enter their zip code**

```
GET /api/bounce-houses?zipCode=12345
```

**Example:**
- Customer enters: "90210"
- System shows: All bounce houses from companies that serve 90210 area

### 2. **City and State Filter**
**User-friendly for customers who prefer city names**

```
GET /api/bounce-houses?city=Los Angeles&state=CA
```

**Example:**
- Customer enters: "Los Angeles, CA"
- System shows: All bounce houses from companies in Los Angeles area

### 3. **Coordinates Search**
**Most accurate - uses GPS or geocoding**

```
GET /api/bounce-houses?latitude=34.0522&longitude=-118.2437
```

**Example:**
- Customer allows location access
- System shows: All bounce houses sorted by exact distance

### 4. **Delivery Radius Filtering**
**Only shows companies that actually deliver to customer**

```
GET /api/bounce-houses?zipCode=12345&deliveryOnly=true
```

**Example:**
- Customer in zip 12345
- System shows: Only bounce houses from companies that deliver to 12345

### 5. **Distance-Based Search**
**Shows bounce houses within X miles**

```
GET /api/bounce-houses?zipCode=12345&radius=15
```

**Example:**
- Customer wants within 15 miles
- System shows: All bounce houses within 15 miles, sorted by distance

## üé™ API Endpoints

```

**Parameters:**

## üè¢ Company Settings

### **Delivery Radius**
Each company sets their delivery radius in miles:
- **Default**: 25 miles
- **Range**: 5-100 miles
- **Configurable**: Company admins can change this

### **Delivery Fee**
Companies can set delivery fees:
- **Default**: $50
- **Range**: $0-$200
- **Distance-based**: Can vary by distance

### **Automatic Geocoding**
Companies' addresses are automatically converted to coordinates:
- **Google Maps API**: If available (most accurate)
- **OpenStreetMap**: Free fallback option
- **Zip Code API**: For zip code lookups

## üì± Customer Experience

### **Search Flow**
1. Customer visits your website
2. Enters location (zip code, city, or allows GPS)
3. Sees bounce houses sorted by distance
4. Each listing shows:
   - Distance from customer
   - "Delivers to your area" indicator
   - Delivery fee
   - Company name and location

### **Example Search Results**
```json
{
  "bounceHouses": [
    {
      "name": "Castle Bounce House",
      "company": "Bob's Bounce Houses",
      "distance": 3.2,
      "withinDeliveryRadius": true,
      "deliveryFee": 25,
      "price": { "daily": 150 }
    },
    {
      "name": "Pirate Ship Adventure",
      "company": "Sally's Fun Rentals", 
      "distance": 8.7,
      "withinDeliveryRadius": true,
      "deliveryFee": 50,
      "price": { "daily": 200 }
    }
  ],
  "total": 2,
  "searchLocation": {
    "coordinates": { "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.2437 },
    "searchType": "zipCode"
  }
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Database Indexes**
Location-based queries are optimized with indexes:
```javascript
// Company collection indexes
{ 'address.zipCode': 1 }
{ 'address.city': 1 }
{ 'address.state': 1 }
{ 'address.coordinates': '2dsphere' }  // Geospatial index
```

### **Distance Calculation**
Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation:
```javascript
function calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) {
  const R = 3959; // Earth's radius in miles
  // Haversine formula implementation
  return distanceInMiles;
}
```

### **Geocoding Services**
Multiple fallback options for reliability:
1. **Google Maps API** (if `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` provided)
2. **OpenStreetMap Nominatim** (free)
3. **Zip Code API** (for zip codes)
