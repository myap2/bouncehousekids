## �️ Merge Protection & CI/CD

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Tests Must Pass Before Merging

This project enforces **mandatory test passing** before any code can be merged into the main branch. **No exceptions.**

### Multi-Layer Protection System

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run linting and related tests before each commit
2. **Pre-push Hooks**: Run full validation suite before pushing to remote
3. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Comprehensive testing on every pull request
4. **Branch Protection Rules**: Block merging if any tests fail
5. **Quality Gates**: Enforce coverage thresholds and security scans

### 🚀 Quick Setup

```bash
# Install all dependencies and set up protection
./setup-merge-protection.sh

# Check current protection status
./check-protection-status.sh
```

### 📋 What Gets Tested Before Merge

Every pull request must pass:
- ✅ **Backend Tests**: All controller, service, and integration tests (98+ test cases)
- ✅ **Frontend Tests**: All React component and utility tests  
- ✅ **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage enforced
- ✅ **Linting**: ESLint and Prettier validation
- ✅ **Security Audit**: No high-severity vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Build Verification**: Both frontend and backend must build successfully
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality validation

### 🔧 Developer Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# 2. Make changes and write tests
# ... develop your feature ...

# 3. Commit (pre-commit hooks run automatically)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
# ✅ Linting and related tests run

# 4. Push (pre-push hooks run automatically)
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
# ✅ Full test suite runs

# 5. Create Pull Request
# ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD runs all tests

# 6. Merge only when all tests pass
# ✅ Branch protection prevents merge if tests fail
```

### 📊 Coverage Requirements

- **Backend**: 80% lines, 80% statements, 75% branches, 80% functions
- **Frontend**: 80% lines, 80% statements, 75% branches, 80% functions

### 🆘 If Tests Fail

**Local failures:**
```bash
# Fix the issues
npm run lint:fix
npm test

# Commit the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve test failures"
```

**CI failures:**
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions logs
# Fix issues locally
npm run validate

# Push fixes
git push
```

2. **Authentication Mocking**: Mock auth middleware for focused testing
3. **External Service Mocking**: Mock Stripe, Google Maps, etc.
4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Test both success and failure paths

### Frontend Testing
1. **Component Isolation**: Test components in isolation
2. **User Interaction Testing**: Test user workflows
3. **State Management**: Verify Redux state changes
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure ARIA compliance

### Code Quality
1. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for test reliability
2. **Test Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
3. **Regression Prevention**: Add tests for every bug fix
4. **Performance Testing**: Monitor test execution time

## 🔄 Test Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Update Dependencies**: Keep testing libraries current
2. **Review Coverage**: Maintain coverage thresholds
3. **Refactor Tests**: Keep tests clean and maintainable
4. **Add New Tests**: Test new features and edge cases

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. **Check Logs**: Review test output and error messages
2. **Isolate Issues**: Run specific test files or suites
3. **Mock Verification**: Ensure mocks are properly configured
4. **Database State**: Verify test data isolation
