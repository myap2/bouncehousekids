node --version
npm --version
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Make the test runner executable
chmod +x run-tests.sh

# Run all tests
./run-tests.sh
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Test Organization
1. **Describe Blocks**: Group related tests logically
2. **Clear Test Names**: Use descriptive test descriptions
3. **Setup/Teardown**: Proper test isolation and cleanup
4. **Mock Management**: Strategic mocking of external dependencies

### Backend Testing
1. **Database Isolation**: Each test uses fresh database state
2. **Authentication Mocking**: Mock auth middleware for focused testing
3. **External Service Mocking**: Mock Stripe, Google Maps, etc.
4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Test both success and failure paths

### Frontend Testing
1. **Component Isolation**: Test components in isolation
2. **User Interaction Testing**: Test user workflows
3. **State Management**: Verify Redux state changes
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure ARIA compliance

### Code Quality
1. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for test reliability
2. **Test Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
3. **Regression Prevention**: Add tests for every bug fix
4. **Performance Testing**: Monitor test execution time

## 🔄 Test Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Update Dependencies**: Keep testing libraries current
2. **Review Coverage**: Maintain coverage thresholds
3. **Refactor Tests**: Keep tests clean and maintainable
4. **Add New Tests**: Test new features and edge cases

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. **Check Logs**: Review test output and error messages
2. **Isolate Issues**: Run specific test files or suites
3. **Mock Verification**: Ensure mocks are properly configured
4. **Database State**: Verify test data isolation
